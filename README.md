# Simulation and Tomographic Reconstruction
### Overview
- The purpose of this educational work is to realize in a first step the simulation of an axial tomograph. then in a second time to find the original image by tomographic reconstruction.

- A similar approach is used in mechanics and metallurgy to perform non-destructive tests or in geology and geophysics to study the different geological layers of a terrain...

### Code
- The code in this tutorial is implemented with Google Colab and is well documented. 

- There are two steps :
    * Simulation of an axial temograph with the RADON transform
    * Tomographic reconstruction with the inverse transform of RADOM TF-1
