# Simulation and Tomographic Reconstruction
### Overview
. The purpose of this mini-project is to realize in a first step the simulation of an axial tomograph. then in a second time to find the original image by tomographic reconstruction.

. A similar approach is used in mechanics and metallurgy to perform non-destructive tests or in geology and geophysics to study the different geological layers of a terrain...
